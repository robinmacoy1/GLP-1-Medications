)
GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) medications are a class of drugs that mimic the action of a hormone called GLP-1, which is naturally produced in the gut. This hormone plays a key role in regulating blood sugar levels, appetite, and digestion. GLP-1 medications have been developed to treat conditions such as type 2 diabetes and obesity, as they help control blood glucose and promote weight loss by acting on various processes in the body.
Some of the most well-known GLP-1 medications include [semaglutide](https://www.ictdemy.com/csharp/csharp-forum/glp-1-medication-plan-how-to-achieve-sustainable-glp-1-for-optimal-weight-loss-at-home-67541c6827828#goto26568
) (brand names like Ozempic, Wegovy), liraglutide (brand names Saxenda and Victoza), and exenatide (Byetta). These medications can be prescribed as injectable treatments and are often used in conjunction with a healthy diet and exercise plan.
